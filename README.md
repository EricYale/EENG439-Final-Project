In order to replicate our process, here are the following steps: 

- For VGG16, type exactly "VGG16" 
- For MobileNetV2, type exactly "MobileNetV2" 

For example: 
```bash 
python3 main.py --model_type "VGG16" 
```

The same process can easily be changed for different base models provided in tensorflow.
